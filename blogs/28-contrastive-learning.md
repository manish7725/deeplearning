# Blog 28 — Contrastive Learning

    <!-- NOTEBOOK-LAB-NAV -->

    ## 🧪 Interactive Lab

    The matching notebook is the hands-on laboratory for this lesson. It should be run after reading the mathematical example below.

    ## 🧭 Where this lesson fits

**Previous lesson:** Blog 27 — Representation Learning.

**Today:** Blog 28 — Contrastive Learning.

**Next lesson:** Blog 29 — Can We Tell a Generative Model What to Create?.

**Student rule:** understand the story first, then the equation, then the code.

    ## 1. The idea in one sentence

    The model learns by being told which examples should be close and which should be far apart.

    ## 2. Explain it like I am in Class 8

    Imagine you are learning a new game. You first notice a pattern, then describe that pattern with a few numbers, and finally test whether your description still works when the example changes. Deep learning does the same thing, but the description can contain millions of learned numbers.

    **Three questions:**
    1. What information goes in?
    2. What transformation turns it into a useful representation?
    3. What evidence tells us whether the transformation worked?

    ## 3. The mathematics

    For an anchor i and positive j, InfoNCE uses L_i=-log exp(sim(z_i,z_j)/tau) / sum_k exp(sim(z_i,z_k)/tau).

    Do not memorize the symbols yet. Translate every symbol into a sentence. In the notebook, we use tiny arrays so every multiplication, average, similarity, or probability can be inspected.

    ## 4. Hand calculation

    Before running Python, make a two- or three-number example yourself. Write every intermediate value. Then run the notebook and compare your answer with the program.

    This is an important rule for this curriculum: **the computer checks your reasoning; it does not replace your reasoning.**

    ## 5. Build the smallest experiment

    Create positive and negative vector pairs, calculate cosine similarities, and see how temperature changes the softmax competition.

    The matching notebook implements this as a reproducible experiment with NumPy and, where appropriate, PyTorch. Change exactly one variable first. Predict the result before running the cell.

    ## 6. What can go wrong?

    **Failure mode:** False negatives can teach the model to push two genuinely related examples apart.

    Also check:
    - shapes and dimensions;
    - numerical stability and finite values;
    - whether the metric actually measures the intended behavior;
    - whether the result changes when the random seed or data split changes.

    ## 7. From intuition to research

    A research question is a question whose answer is not known from the lesson alone. Examples:

    - Which assumption in this method matters most?
    - What happens when that assumption is deliberately broken?
    - Which metric changes first when the model fails?
    - Does the result survive a different dataset, seed, or architecture?

    For graduate work, turn one question into a falsifiable hypothesis, define a baseline, predefine the metric, run controlled ablations, and report uncertainty rather than only the best run.

    ## 8. Mini-project

    Build a toy version using at least two competing methods. Keep the data fixed, change only the method, and record the result in a small table containing **hypothesis, setup, metric, result, interpretation**.

    ## 9. Mastery gate

    You are ready to continue when you can:

    - explain the idea without using jargon;
    - calculate the tiny example by hand;
    - run and modify the notebook;
    - explain one failure mode;
    - connect the lesson to the next chapter;
    - propose one experiment that could prove your explanation wrong.

    ## What to remember

    > **Deep learning is not a collection of APIs. It is mathematics, computation, experiments, and evidence connected into one learning process.**
